      <h1>GLORIOUS HISTORY OF ROMAN LEGION</h1>
      <p>
        The Roman legions were truly the legendary fighting force every occured in history. Effective as in Battle Of Boudica, Legions of consisting 10,000 soldiers fighting against massive 230,000 soldier's of British Empire and Allies marked
        decisive Roman victory only at a cost of 400 men and killing 80,000 enemy soldiers.When it came to siege warfare, the Romans were undisputed masters. Their ingenuity in siege engineering, both in equipment and in infrastructure, was
        second-to-none in the ancient world.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h1>What Makes Them Legendary?</h1>
      <p>
        ⛨ They were highly disciplined. The rules the legionnaires were expected to follow were rigorous, and punishment for infractions was harsh. Furthermore, discipline was very consistent across all legions, so there was not a significant
        variance in quality from one unit to the next.<br>
        <br>
        ⛨ They were well armed and equipped, and there was diversification in the composition of troops. In addition to the classic heavy infantry (each wearing body armor and helmet and carrying a shield, gladius and pilum), a legion also comprised
        a cavalry force, both heavy and light, intended to protect against flanking actions by opposing cavalry as well as to break up enemy infantry units. They also had light infantry units, or velites, armed with javelins who served as both
        skirmishers and as scouts.<br>
        <br>
        ⛨ Their tactics were effective. The typical assault began with the velites advancing to hurl their javelins, then retreat behind the heavy infantry. The heavy infantryman would wait until opponents were within 30 yards, then hurl his pilum
        into the ranks of the enemy. He would then lock shields with his neighbors to form a shield wall and use his gladius to stab, not hack, at his opponent over the top of his shield, or under it to hamstring the enemy. Meanwhile, the cavalry
        would maneuver around the flanks to either harrass the opposing infantry or engage the opposing cavalry. Furthermore, they chose to put their greenest troops in the front ranks of the legion, for two reasons — veteran soldiers were too
        valuable to risk in a frontal assault, and with them ranked behind the inexperienced troops they could simultaneously encourage them and help prevent them from abandoning the front line and retreating toward the rear.
        <br>
        <br>
        ⛨ They were flexible. Legions were defeated in battle from time to time, quite famously. However, instead of rigidly clinging to the tactics they had trained for, the Roman commanders would adapt their tactics to adjust for situations that
        had previously worked against them.

      <h1>Ranks And Officers Of The Legion</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h3 align="center"><u>Senior Officers Of The Roman Legion
        </u>
      </h3>
      <p><strong>1.Legatus Legionis </strong><br>
        The overall Legionary commander. This post was generally appointed by the emperor, was a former Tribune and held command for 3 or 4 years, although could serve for a much longer period. In a province with only one legion, the Legatus was also
        the provincial governor and in provinces with multiple legions, each legion has a Legatus and the provincial governor has overall command of them all.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>2.Tribunus Laticlavius </strong>
        Named for the broad striped toga worn by men of senatorial rank. This tribune was appointed by the Emperor or the Senate. Though generally quite young and less experienced than the Tribuni Angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the
        legion, behind the Legate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> 3.Praefectus Castrorum</strong>
        The camp Prefect. Generally he was a long serving veteran who had been promoted through the ranks of the centurions and was 3rd in overall command.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> 4.Tribuni Angusticlavii</strong>
        Each legion had 5 military tribunes of equestrian (knight) class citizens. They were in many cases career officers and served many of the important administrative tasks of the Legion, but still served in a full tactical command function
        during engagements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>5.Primus Pilus</strong>
        The "First File" was the commanding centurion of the first cohort and the senior centurion of the entire Legion. Service in this position also allowed entry into the equestrian social class upon retirement.
      </p>

      <hr id="hr2">
      <h3 align="center"><u>Mid-Level Officers Of The Roman Legion</u></h3>

      <p>
        <strong> 1.Centurions</strong>
        Each Legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each centuria of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day to day life of the soldiers as well as issuing commands in the
        field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the Emperor or other higher ranking officials.

        The cohorts were ranked from the First to the Tenth and the Centuria within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only 5 Centuria in the First Cohort (For a total of 59 Centuria and the Primus Pilus). The Centuria that each Centurion commanded
        was a direct reflection of his rank. (Command of the First Centuria of the First Cohort was the highest and the 6th Centuria of the 10th Cohort was the lowest). The 5 Centurions of the First Cohort were called the Primi Ordines, and included
        the Primus Pilus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> 2.Pilus Prior </strong>
        The commander of the first cohort of each Centuria (except the first), with the following titles for the Centurions in sequence throughout each Centuria.
        <br>
        <h4>
          I. Pilus Posteriorbr

          II. Princeps Prior
          <br>
          <br>
          III. Princeps Posterior
          <br>
          <br>
          IV. Hastatus Prior
          <br>
          <br>
          V. Hastatus Posterior
      </p>
      </h4>

      <hr id="hr1">
      <hr id="hr2">

      <h3 align="center"><u>Low-Level Officers in the Roman Legion
        </u>
      </h3>

      <p> <strong>I. Principales</strong>
        The Principales would be the equivalent of modern day non-commissioned officers and had the following rank structures from highest to lowest:
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>II. Aquilifer</strong>
        A single position within the Legion. The Aquilifer was the Legion's Standard or Eagle bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. The next step up would be a post as a Centurion.
        <br><br>

        <strong>III. Signifer</strong>
        Each Centuria had a Signifer (59). He was responsible for the men's pay and savings, and the standard bearer for the Centurial Signum, a spear shaft decorated with medallions and often topped with an open hand to signify the oath of loyalty
        taken by the soldiers. It was this banner that the men from each individual Centuria would rally around. A soldier could also gain the position of Discentes signiferorum, or standard bearer in training.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>IV. Optio</strong>
        One for each Centurion (59), they were appointed by the Centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>V. Tesserarius (Guard Commander)</strong>
        Again there were 59 of these, or one for each Centuria. They acted in similar roles to the Optios.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>VI. Cornicen (Horn Blower)</strong>
        They worked hand in hand with the Signifer drawing the attention of the men to the Centurial Signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>VII. Imaginifer</strong>
        Carried the Standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troop's loyalty to him.
